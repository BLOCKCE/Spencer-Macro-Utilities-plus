# Roblox Macro Client
An open-source Windows C++ Roblox ImGui Macro with many features.

To Compile, run the project in Visual Studio 2022 and build it.

### Is this A CHEAT???
No, it's a macro, it doesn't communicate with Roblox memory in any way.

### Known Issues
If you get "0x0" or any other key immediately when binding, restart your PC.

If you get DLL errors when launching, install [The Visual Studio 2022 x64 C++ Redist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).

If it doesn't launch at all, go into properties and select "Unblock" on the file.

If you have another issue where keybinds don't work, restart your computer, it seems to fix it permanently.
