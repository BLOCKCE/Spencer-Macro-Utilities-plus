# Roblox-Macro-Utilities
An open-source Windows C++ Roblox Macro with many features.

# Instructions

Unzip the `.zip` and run the `.cmd` to run the program.  
Head to **[Parameters and Hotkeys](#parameters-and-hotkeys)** for Hotkey Information.
To Compile, run the project in Visual Studio 2022 and build it.

## Roblox Anti-AFK

If you don't press `W` for fifteen minutes, a `"."` will be sent in the chat. This works even if Roblox is not the currently focused process.

## Macro Speedglitch

If you use a Center of Mass offset, you can trick the engine into forcing a lot of forward momentum.

- **Non-fixed camera module:** The value for the speed glitch will be `360` divided by your Roblox sensitivity.
- **Fixed camera module:** The value will be `500` divided by your sensitivity.
- **For BOTH:** Subtract 2-3 (or more) from the final result before placing it in the .cmd.

**See [Parameters and Hotkeys](#parameters-and-hotkeys) for more information.**

## Drop-less Item Desync

Keep an item hitbox permanently on by setting it to your `"5"` slot and activating its hold hotkey for 3-5 seconds.

## Tab-glitch Remotely

You can freeze and unfreeze your game instantly by holding a button. Pretty simple, with tons of uses.

## Wallhop Macro

Lets you wallhop with a specific distanceâ€”self-explanatory.

## Walless Lag High Jump

By shifting your Center of Mass and using this macro, you will always perform a 14 stud LHJ (Lag High Jump).

## Press "D" for One Frame

A general script that presses a button for one frame when you press a separate button.

Inside the code is also a framework for pasting strings into chat, though it is currently unused.

1. Roblox Process Name  (Default: RobloxPlayerBeta.exe)

  - Alternatively, go [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes) and select your key from the `"value"` column.
