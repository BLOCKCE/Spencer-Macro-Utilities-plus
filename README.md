# Roblox Macro Client
An open-source Windows C++ Roblox ImGui Macro with many features.

To Compile, run the project in Visual Studio 2022 and build it.

### Is this A CHEAT???
No, it's a macro, it doesn't communicate with Roblox memory in any way.

If it doesn't launch at all, go into properties and select "Unblock" on the file.

If you get "0x0" when binding, restart your PC

Do not run it from the Windows Search Bar, run it from file explorer, this will be fixed later

If you get DLL errors when launching, install [The Visual Studio 2022 x64 C++ Redist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).
